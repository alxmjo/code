One of the tasks I had to complete in preparation for my starting classes at Oregon State was a class plan listing which classes I plan on taking each term. Here's what I came up with:

* **Fall '16** 
    * Intro to Computer Science I (CS 161)
* **Winter '17** 
    * Discrete Structures (CS 225)
* **Spring '17** 
    * Intro to Computer Science II (CS 162)
* **Summer '17** 
    * Data Structures (CS 261)
    * Computer Architecture and Assembly Language (CS 271)
* **Fall '17** 
    * Web Development (CS 290)
    * Introduction to Databases (CS 340)
* **Winter '18** 
    * Operating Systems (CS 344)
    * Introduction to Usability Engineering (CS 352)
* **Spring '18** 
    * Software Engineering I (CS 361)
    * Analysis of Algorithms (CS 325)
* **Summer '18** 
    * Software Engineering II (CS 362) 
    * Mobile and Cloud Software Development (CS 496)
* **Fall '18** 
    * Intro to Computer Networks (CS 372)
    * Software Projects (CS 419)

This schedule doesn't follow any specific [tracks](http://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/undergraduate/computer-science/tracks.htm) laid out by Oregon State, but it's tailor-made around the fact that I'll be working for the next ten months and then focusing on school full-time after that.

As for this blog, I plan on posting at least one post per course, and hopefully more.
