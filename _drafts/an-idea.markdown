I'm teaching myself how to program and plan on using this blog as a means of tracking my progress. As my journey began a long time ago and I'm only now beginning to document it, let me back up a bit.

I've been interested in programming computers ever since I set up my first website on some free, ad-laden hosting service back when I was about ten or twelve years-old. It was simple and pointless, made up of a few pages of information about myself and jokes I thought were funny. I didn't know anything about HTML at the time, but because of Frontpage and then Dreamweaver, that didn't really matter. It was cool to put something together on a computer and make it available to the world. 

In college I started a few WordPress blogs which quickly fizzled, but in the process developed a taste for fiddling with the backend to make everything look and behave just so. It wasn't programming, of course, and even hacking seems like a generous term. I'd just copy and paste little bits of code and see what happened. I started an online book called PHP 101 but only made it a few chapters before giving up. I wanted to know how to code, but I didn't really want to learn.

Over the years I played around with JavaScript (studying with Lynda) and then Python (Codecademy), but I didn't really know what I wanted to do, and didn't want it bad enough to make learning how to program a real priority in my life. When I started working in media in 2011 I began to see what a and then as the digital editor for a national radio show in 

####Running

Rachael was looking up running routes in Prague when she came upon a listing for a guy named Radim who does running tours of the city. A couple of days and fifty euros later, he met us at our apartment and led us on a ten mile tour of the city, running all the way.

*Radim carried a camera and took pictures of us during the run, including this last one of all of us together.*

He told us about the history of the Prague, from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the world wars, and through Communism to the present. We never paused for more than a minute at a time, so it was an excellent way to see most of the main tourist sites in a short period of time. Had we been walking it would've taken a full day or more. 

 The history was interesting, but the best part about the tour was having the opportunity to get to know a local Praguer. It's hard to get a feel for a place without spending a while talking to someone who lives there.

####Sciencing

While on one of our Rachael-guided walking tours we came upon the Klementinum Observatory where Tycho Brahe accurately recorded the movements of the planets and where Johannes Kepler formulated his laws of planetary motion (namely, that planets orbit the sun in ellipses rather than concentric circles).

A few days later Rachael was patient enough to accompany me to Prague's Národni Technické Muzeum (National Technical Museum) where they had an entire exhibit dedicated to the original tools of astronomical research, including the actual sextants that Brahe and Kepler used. Pretty cool. 

####Escaping

Another cool thing that Rachael organized on our trip (the alternate title of this post was "Cool Things Rachael Planned for Our Vacation) was a trip to one of Prague's "escape games", wherein you're locked in a room and have to figure out how to escape. Rachael and I undertook this challenge with Gordy and Suellen on our last full day in Prague, and it ended up being one of my favorite parts of the trip. 

The most popular escape game in Prague was booked for our entire stay, but we were able to make a reservation with [TRAP](http://www.trapprague.com/), one of its competitors. 

In order for us to diffuse the "bomb" which had been planted in our room and make our escape we had to decode hidden messages, read Braille, navigate mazes, and peddle a stationary bicycle really, really hard (thanks Suellen), among other challenges.

*Bomb defused, game completed!*

If you ever come across an opportunity to be locked in a basement and try to escape, first make sure it's just a game, and then do it. I promise you won't regret it. 

##Headed Home

Rachael and I are headed home as I type this. We'll have a couple days to get our bearings in Doha, and then we're back to work. Happy New Year.
