*My daughter and me.*

My name is Alex, and this is a rebirth. Having spent most of my twenties in a variety of pursuits, including farming, social services, journalism, and education, I'm currently drilling down on the education bit in the belief that a little extra focus will take me a lot farther. I'm studying math and computer science and plan on teaching those subjects when I graduate.

This blog serves two goals: to [make my learning visible](http://www.mlvpz.org/) and to help me understand myself and my growth. That makes it like a journal - hastily written, poorly edited, and mostly for my benefit. That said, I care about what I write, and I hope you do too.

If you'd like to know more about me and what I get up to, see my [personal blog](http://alexmontjohn.com/) or any of the sites below.
